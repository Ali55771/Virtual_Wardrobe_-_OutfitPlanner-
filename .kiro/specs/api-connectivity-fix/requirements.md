# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical API connectivity issues between the React Native frontend and Flask backend for the AI recommendation system. The current implementation fails to establish proper network connections, resulting in users being unable to receive outfit recommendations. This feature will implement robust connection handling, proper error management, and fallback mechanisms to ensure a reliable user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the recommendation system to work reliably across different network conditions, so that I can always get outfit suggestions when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Generate" with valid inputs THEN the system SHALL attempt to connect to the API server within 10 seconds
2. WHEN the API server is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN the network connection is slow THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator and wait up to 30 seconds before timing out
4. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry the request up to 3 times with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API endpoint configuration management, so that the app can connect to different server environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the correct API endpoint based on the platform and environment
2. WHEN running on Android emulator THEN the system SHALL use the correct localhost mapping (10.0.2.2)
3. WHEN running on physical device THEN the system SHALL use the configured local IP address
4. WHEN the primary endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback endpoints if configured

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want informative error messages when the recommendation system fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is not running THEN the system SHALL display "Server is not running. Please start the backend service."
2. WHEN there's a network connectivity issue THEN the system SHALL display "Network connection failed. Please check your internet connection."
3. WHEN the server returns an error THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message from the server
4. WHEN the request times out THEN the system SHALL display "Request timed out. Please try again."

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and resolve API connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call is made THEN the system SHALL log the request URL, payload, and timestamp
2. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error type, message, and response details
3. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display detailed network information in the console
4. WHEN connection attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log each attempt with timing information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to gracefully handle server downtime, so that I can still use other features when recommendations are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recommendation API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL allow users to continue using other app features
2. WHEN the server is down THEN the system SHALL cache the last successful connection settings for future attempts
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically retry failed requests
4. WHEN in offline mode THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance about when to retry
